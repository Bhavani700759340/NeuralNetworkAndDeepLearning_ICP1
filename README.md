This is short summary on 3 questions mentioned in IPC 1. 
For first program, first part I used slicing operations for deletion and reversing and written code. Code is saved in file named as DeleteAndReverseOfString.py. 
For first program, second part I considered 4 arthematic operations ie)addition, subtraction, multiplication and modulo and code is saved in ArthematicOperations.py
For Second program, I did this problem in 2 ways with predefined method "replace" and with a while loop. I presented that codes in files named as ReplaceOccurance_1.py 
and ReplaceOccurance_2.py
For third program, I used our class grading scale and placed that code in file named as LetterBasedGrading.py
